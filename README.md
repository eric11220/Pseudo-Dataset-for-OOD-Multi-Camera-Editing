## *Pseudo Dataset Generation for Out-of-Domain Multi-Camera View Recommendation*
----

This repository is an official implementation of *Pseudo Dataset Generation for Out-of-Domain Multi-Camera View Recommendation* in Pytorch (VCIP 2024)


## Abstract
Multi-camera systems are indispensable in movies, TV shows, and other media. Selecting the appropriate camera at every timestamp has a decisive impact on production quality and audience preferences. Learning-based view recommendation frameworks can assist professionals in decision-making. However, they often struggle outside of their training domains. The scarcity of labeled multi-camera view recommendation datasets exacerbates the issue. Based on the insight that many videos are edited from the original multi-camera videos, we propose transforming regular videos into pseudo-labeled multi-camera view recommendation datasets. Promisingly, by training the model on pseudo-labeled datasets stemming from videos in the target domain, we achieve a 68% relative improvement in the model's accuracy in the target domain and bridge the accuracy gap between in-domain and never-before-seen domains.

### Contribution
- We identify the poor domain generalizability of multicamera view recommendation models.
- We propose generating pseudo-labeled multi-camera editing datasets with regular videos to mitigate the lack of labeled data on an arbitrary domain.
- With the proposed pseudo-labeled multi-camera editing datasets, we achieve a 68% relative improvement in the modelâ€™s classification accuracy in the target domain.

## Requirement
Installing packages
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Pseudo Dataset Generation Given a Video or Directory of Videos
```
bash generate.sh video_path
```
This will
- Run shot boundary detection on all videos and write results for individual videos to `output/shot_bouundaries`.
- Create a JSON file `output/shots.json` that contains the start and end frames for every video shot.
- Generate the pseudo dataset in a JSON file `output/pseudo_data.json` and individual frames from each video in `output/frames`.


The format of `pseuudo_data.json` is as follows, adapted from [TVMCE](https://github.com/VirtualFilmStudio/TVMCE).
